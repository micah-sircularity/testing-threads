# Testing Threads: Thread ID Verification

This project, "testing-threads" (originally "thread-id-test"), is a simple web application designed to demonstrate and verify how thread IDs are handled in a web browser environment. It aims to provide a clear understanding of whether different JavaScript execution contexts (e.g., main thread, web workers) are assigned distinct thread IDs.

## Problem Statement

The core problem this code addresses is understanding thread ID management in JavaScript. Specifically, it investigates:

*   **Do different JavaScript execution contexts (main thread vs. web workers) have unique thread IDs?**
*   **How can we reliably identify and differentiate between these threads?**

This understanding is crucial for debugging, performance optimization, and ensuring proper synchronization in multi-threaded JavaScript applications.

## Setup Instructions

This project is a standard web application and requires a web browser to run.  Here's how to set it up:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd testing-threads
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies (Optional):**

    While this project doesn't strictly *require* `npm install` to run, it's good practice to do so, especially if you plan to modify the code or use any build tools later.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command uses `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to install any listed dependencies.  In this case, it's likely there are no explicit dependencies, but running this ensures a consistent environment.

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

    Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it using your browser's "Open File" option.

## Usage Examples

The application will likely display information about the current thread ID.  Here are some things you can try:

1.  **Basic Thread ID Display:**

    The `script.js` file probably contains code to retrieve and display the thread ID of the main thread.  Observe the output in the browser's console or on the page itself.

2.  **Web Worker Thread ID:**

    If the application includes web workers, it will create one or more workers and display their thread IDs.  Compare the thread ID of the main thread with the thread IDs of the web workers.  This will demonstrate whether they are unique.  Look for output in the console related to worker threads.

3.  **Repeated Execution:**

    Run the application multiple times or refresh the page.  Observe if the thread ID changes between executions.  This can help determine if thread IDs are persistent or dynamically assigned.

4.  **Inspect the Console:**

    Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12).  The `script.js` file likely uses `console.log()` to output thread ID information.  This is the primary way to observe the results.

## Notable Features and Components

*   **`index.html`:** The main HTML file that provides the structure and user interface of the application.
*   **`style.css`:**  The stylesheet that controls the visual appearance of the application.
*   **`script.js`:**  The JavaScript file containing the core logic for retrieving and displaying thread IDs, and potentially creating and managing web workers.  This is where the thread ID testing logic resides.
*   **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`:**  These files manage project dependencies (though they might be empty in this simple example).  They are used by `npm` (Node Package Manager).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:

*   **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure you are using a modern web browser that supports web workers (if applicable).
*   **JavaScript Errors:** Check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.  These errors can prevent the thread ID testing logic from executing correctly.
*   **Security Restrictions:** Some browsers may have security restrictions that prevent access to thread IDs.  If you are running the application from a local file, try serving it from a simple web server (e.g., using `npx serve` or `python -m http.server`).
*   **Incorrect Thread ID Retrieval:**  The method used to retrieve the thread ID might be browser-specific or unreliable.  Research alternative methods if the current implementation is not working.  (Note: There is no standard JavaScript API for directly accessing thread IDs.  The code likely uses a workaround or browser-specific API.)

**If you are trying to fix a specific issue related to thread ID retrieval or comparison, please provide more details about the problem you are facing.  For example:**

*   "The thread IDs are always the same, even for web workers."
*   "I'm getting an error when trying to access the thread ID."
*   "The thread ID is undefined."

Providing specific details will help in diagnosing and resolving the issue.
